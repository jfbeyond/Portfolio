# Portfolio

Portfolio of personal web development projects

## What it contains:

The portfolio project has the following structure:

### CSS Folder:

1. style.css: This is the cascading style sheet that I customized for my personal portfolio webpage. It uses basic tags defining properties for the different tags utilized.

2. bootstrap.min.css: I got this file for responsive design from getbootstrap [website](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/). They offer introduction into bootstrap and also templates for different website styles.

### Images Folder:

It contains all the relevant images utilized in my portfolio: logo, main image and three project pictures. In the html file is indicated where I obtained the images from.

### index.html: 

HTML file with the layout and contents of my portfolio.

## How to see it:

Please clone the project into your computer (folders and html file) and save it keeping its directory structure. Open the html file with your favorite browser.
I will deploy it soon so it can be visible from the web.
